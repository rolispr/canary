;;; A scrollable history pane, a textinput at the bottom, and a fake
;;; message stream installed via (every) on <init>. Tab cycles focus
;;; between history (scroll with j/k) and input (typing). Enter posts
;;; your message and the fake bot replies after a delay.
;;;
;;; Run: guile -L /path/to/guile-canary examples/chat.scm
;;; Tab    switch focus between input and history
;;; j / k  scroll history (when history is focused)
;;; ↵      send (when input is focused)
;;; ctrl-c quit
