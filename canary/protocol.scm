;;; Commentary:

;;; Wire types between the engine and user code.  Two kinds of value
;;; cross the boundary:

;;;   * Events  — input flowing from the world into the app's react
;;;               procedure.  GOOPS classes; pattern-matched with
;;;               `is-a?` predicates.
;;;
;;;   * Cmds    — declarative requests returned by react, interpreted
;;;               by the engine (set the title, install a ticker, run
;;;               a subprocess, etc.).  Tagged lists or bare symbols.
