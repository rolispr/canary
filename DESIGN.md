# canary

A TUI library for Guile. You describe the screen as a tree, the engine
turns it into terminal cells. Edit your code in the REPL and the next
render reflects the change.

The unit is a **node**. `vbox`, `txt`, `boxed` are nodes. A spinner is
a node. A file browser is a node. Your whole app is a node. Nodes nest
in other nodes; the engine walks one tree.

Stateful nodes mutate themselves in place, returning cmds when they
want the engine to do something — start a timer, swap palettes, quit.

Color is by name. `#:fg 'accent` reads from the active palette;
`(cycle-palette)` flips palettes and every reference recolors at once.
Styling attributes are individual flags (`#:bold #:italic`), not a
list.

## Hello, counter

```scheme
(use-modules (canary) (oop goops))

(define-class <counter> ()
  (n #:init-keyword #:n #:init-value 0 #:accessor counter-n))

(define-method (view (c <counter>) sz)
  (txt (number->string (counter-n c))))

(define-method (update (c <counter>) (msg <key>) sz)
  (case (key-sym msg)
    ((#\+) (set! (counter-n c) (+ 1 (counter-n c))) (values c #f))
    ((#\-) (set! (counter-n c) (- (counter-n c) 1)) (values c #f))
    (else  (values c #f))))

(define-method (update (c <counter>) msg sz) (values c #f))

(run-app (make <counter>)
         #:title  "counter"
         #:keymap (keymap (bind 'escape 'quit)))
```

That's everything. A GOOPS class for state, methods for `view` and
`update`, `run-app` to launch.

## Architecture

Two generics drive every node:

```
view   : (lambda (self sz)     → child-node)
update : (lambda (self msg sz) → (values self cmd-or-#f))   ; optional
```

Specialise them on your class. Startup logic is just `update`
specialised on the `<init>` msg:

```scheme
(define-method (update (c <my-app>) (msg <init>) sz)
  (values c (load-cmd c)))           ; same (model, cmd) shape as every update
```

Layout records (`txt`, `vbox`, `hbox`, `boxed`, `pad`, `align`,
`width`, `height`, `overlay`, `pin`, `on-click`, `on-hover`) are pure
data — no methods, no state. The renderer walks them by type-check.
When it reaches a GOOPS instance in the tree, it calls `(view instance
sz)` to expand.

The engine:

- runs a channel-backed event loop
- reads input (keys, mouse) and emits typed msgs
- renders `(view root sz)`, populates click regions, draws cell diffs
- on each msg, walks the rendered tree and calls `(update node msg sz)`
  on every GOOPS instance found
- collects cmds from each update's second return value, batches them,
  runs them
- spawns fibers for cmds that need them (`every`, `after`, user thunks)

`run-app` takes any GOOPS instance and config kwargs. No `<app>` base
class to subclass — your class inherits from whatever you want, or
nothing.

### Composition

`view` returns a tree of nodes — layout records and GOOPS instances
mixed freely. **Embed widgets by instance reference, never by
expanding them via `(view child sz)` in your own view.** The renderer
calls `view` on a GOOPS instance for you; the cascade walks the tree
and dispatches `update` on every instance it finds. There is no
container that "doesn't support widgets": every layout primitive that
takes a child also takes a GOOPS child.

```scheme
(define-class <chat> ()
  (lines #:init-value '()             #:accessor chat-lines)
  (input #:init-form (make-textinput) #:accessor chat-input))

(define-method (view (c <chat>) sz)
  (vbox (apply vbox (map (lambda (l) (txt l)) (chat-lines c)))
        (chat-input c)))                ; ← the <textinput>, not (view it sz)
```

Nest as deep as you want:

```scheme
(vbox
 (boxed (make-dired #:path "/foo") #:title "left")
 (hbox  (align (make-spinner) 'center #:width 20)
        (pad   (make-button #:label "ok" #:action 'save) #:left 2)
        (width (chat-input app) 40)))
```

The cascade reaches every embedded widget regardless of depth or
container kind. Each widget's `update` mutates state in place and
returns `(values self cmd-or-#f)`. Widgets that don't care about a
given msg fall through the default catch-all and return
`(values self #f)`.

#### Anti-pattern

```scheme
;; DON'T: cascade can't see the textinput through expanded layout records.
(vbox (view (chat-input c) sz))
```

Use `(chat-input c)`. The engine expands it for rendering and visits
it during cascade.

### Focus

Key and mouse msgs are routed to the **focus chain** — a path of
GOOPS instances from root to the currently focused widget — not
broadcast to every widget. This stops two `<textinput>`s in the same
tree from both consuming a typed character.

Default focus is the root widget. Move focus with the `focus` cmd:

```scheme
(define-method (update (c <chat>) (msg <init>) sz)
  (values c (focus (chat-input c))))    ; ← input gets keys from the first frame
```

The chain is `root → … → target`, resolved by the engine walking the
source tree. Keys / mouse msgs are dispatched **leaf-to-root**: the
deepest focused widget gets the first crack, then each ancestor up
the chain, so a textinput can insert a char and chat above it can
still see enter and append a line — both fire in order:

```scheme
(define-method (update (c <chat>) (msg <key>) sz)
  (when (eq? (key-sym msg) 'return)
    (let ((val (textinput-value (chat-input c))))
      (unless (zero? (string-length val))
        (set! (chat-lines c) (cons val (chat-lines c)))
        (set! (textinput-value (chat-input c)) "")
        (set! (textinput-cursor (chat-input c)) 0))))
  (values c #f))
```

No "consumed, stop" sentinel — every node in the chain fires for
every key/mouse msg. Compose by ordering state mutations across
update methods.

Non-key/mouse msgs (`<init>`, `<tick>`, `<resize>`, focus/blur,
keymap-mapped actions like `'save`, `on-click` action symbols, user
msgs sent via `send`) still **broadcast** through the whole tree —
that's the right shape for "tick all animations" or "everyone gets
init" or "any widget can react to 'save."

Subscription lifetime: an `every` or `after` cmd without `#:id`
installs an anonymous fiber that lives until the engine stops — no
way to cancel. With `#:id`, the engine maps that id to the fiber.
Re-issuing the same `(every #:id k …)` is idempotent (a no-op if k
is already installed). `(cancel k)` stops it.

```scheme
;; A spinner that ticks only while loading.
(define-method (update (c <my>) (msg <init>) sz) (values c #f))

(define-method (update (c <my>) (msg <load-start>) sz)
  (values c (every #:hz 10 #:id 'spinner-tick (lambda () (tick)))))

(define-method (update (c <my>) (msg <load-done>) sz)
  (values c (cancel 'spinner-tick)))
```

The id is any `eq?`-comparable Scheme value — a symbol, a widget
instance, a `(list 'tick widget)` pair for per-instance ids. Returning
the same `(every #:id … …)` cmd every update is fine and cheap; the
engine only spawns once.

## Live coding

```
make repl
```

opens a Geiser-listenable image. From an Emacs/VS Code Geiser session:

- `C-M-x` on a `(define-method (view (c <counter>) sz) …)` form
  replaces the method body. Existing instances dispatch to the new
  body on the next render.
- `C-M-x` on a `(define-class <counter> () …)` form triggers Guile's
  class-redefinition protocol. Existing instances migrate to the new
  slot layout.
- `(set! (counter-n c) 99)` from the REPL mutates a slot directly.
- Re-evaluate a theme to swap palettes or restyle.

No rebuild loop. The process keeps running across edits.

## Msgs

Engine-emitted records matched in `update`.

| record    | when                                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `<key>`   | a keystroke (with optional modifiers)         |
| `<mouse>` | mouse button / motion / scroll                |
| `<tick>`  | an `every` or `after` cmd fired               |
| `<resize>`| terminal size changed                         |
| `<init>`  | once before the first user input              |
| `<focus>` | terminal gained focus (msg ctor: `(focused)`) |
| `<blur>`  | terminal lost focus  (msg ctor: `(blurred)`)  |
| `<resume>`| engine reacquired tty after suspend           |
| symbol    | keymap action; `on-click` action; user msg    |
| list      | any user-defined shape via `(send eng …)`     |

Multi-method dispatch on the msg class is the natural shape:

```scheme
(define-method (update (c <my>) (msg <tick>) sz) …)
(define-method (update (c <my>) (msg <key>)  sz) …)
(define-method (update (c <my>) msg sz) (values c #f))   ; catch-all
```

## Cmds

Returned from `update` (second value). Cmds are constructor calls,
not quoted literals.

| cmd                                 | effect                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `#f`                                | no-op                                   |
| `'quit`                             | exit `run-app`                          |
| `(batch c1 c2 …)`                   | parallel                                |
| `(sequence c1 c2 …)`                | sequential, awaits each                 |
| `(every #:hz N [#:id k] producer)`  | persistent ticker — one fiber; cancel with `(cancel k)` |
| `(every #:ms N [#:id k] producer)`  | same                                    |
| `(after #:ms N [#:id k] producer)`  | one-shot timer; cancel with `(cancel k)` before it fires |
| `(cancel id)`                       | stop a sub installed with that `#:id`   |
| `(println "string" …)`              | line to scrollback above alt-screen     |
| `(set-title "name")`                | runtime OS title change                 |
| `(clear-screen)`                    | force full repaint                      |
| `(cursor 'hidden│'visible│'bar│…)`  | runtime cursor change                   |
| `(alt-screen 'on│'off)`             | runtime alt-screen toggle               |
| `(mouse-mode 'off│'click│'cell│'all)` | runtime mouse mode change             |
| `(set-palette 'name)`               | switch active palette                   |
| `(cycle-palette)`                   | next palette in theme's declared order  |
| `(suspend)`                         | hand tty to shell, resume on SIGCONT    |
| `(exec "cmd args" #:on-done thunk)` | tear down, run process, restore, msg    |
| `(focus widget)`                    | route key/mouse msgs to this widget chain |
| user thunk                          | engine spawns fiber; thunk returns msg  |

## Click & hover

```scheme
(on-click action child)
(on-hover child styler-proc)
```

`on-click` wraps any child so a left-press inside its rendered area
dispatches `action` as a msg. `on-hover` swaps `child` for
`(styler-proc child)` whenever the cursor is inside the area — purely
visual.

```scheme
(on-click 'save
          (on-hover (txt " save " #:fg 'muted)
                    (lambda (_) (txt " save " #:fg 'accent #:bold))))
```

## Keys and keymap

```scheme
(keymap
 (bind k1 [k2 …] action [#:timeout-ms N])
 …)
```

| form                                    | meaning                    |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `#\h`, `#\?`, `#\:`                     | literal char               |
| `#\tab` `#\escape` `#\space` `#\return` `#\delete` `#\backspace` | named chars |
| `'left` `'right` `'up` `'down` `'home` `'end` `'pgup` `'pgdn` `'f1`…`'f12` | symbols |
| `'(#\x ctrl)` `'(left ctrl)`            | modifier list              |
| `'(mouse left)` `'(mouse right)`        | mouse button               |
| `'(mouse-scroll up)` `'(mouse-scroll down)` | scroll wheel           |

Modifiers: `control`/`ctrl`, `alt`/`meta`/`option`, `shift`,
`super`/`cmd`/`command`. Canonicalised, sorted, deduped internally.

```scheme
(bind #\q 'quit)
(bind 'escape 'cancel)
(bind '(#\x ctrl) 'cut)
(bind #\g #\g 'top #:timeout-ms 500)
(bind '(mouse left) 'select)
```

`'quit` is engine-intercepted. Anything else is dispatched to
`update`.

## Theme

```scheme
(define ui
  (theme
   (palette dark
     (bg     "#0a0d18")
     (fg     "#d8d2c2")
     (muted  "#5a6378")
     (accent "#ffd05e")
     (note   "#ff6b9d"))

   (palette light
     (bg     "#f8f5ec")
     (fg     "#1a1a1a")
     (muted  "#605850")
     (accent "#a06b14")
     (note   "#c01666"))))
```

- `palette` blocks list named hex colors. First declared is the default.
- Every palette should define the same set of names. Names not present
  in every palette fall back to the default palette's value when
  swapped.
- The engine tracks registered palettes; `(cycle-palette)` and
  `(set-palette 'light)` work without the user maintaining a list.

For reusable styling combos, define a helper:

```scheme
(define (hint s) (txt s #:fg 'muted #:italic))
(define (note s) (txt s #:fg 'note  #:bold))
```

## Layout primitives

```scheme
(txt "hello")
(txt "hello" #:fg 'accent #:bold)
(txt "saved: " (txt name #:fg 'note #:bold))   ; nested = inline span
(txt "tmp" #:fg "#ff0000")                     ; inline hex
```

Styling kwargs on `txt`:

- `#:fg` / `#:bg` — hex string (`"#abc123"`) or palette name (`'accent`)
- `#:bold` `#:italic` `#:underline` `#:reverse` `#:strike` `#:dim` —
  individual boolean flags.

Containers:

```scheme
(vbox a b c)
(hbox a b c)
(spacer n)                                ; height in vbox
(spacer #:w n)                            ; width  in hbox
(pad    child #:top n #:left n …)         ; inner whitespace
(margin child #:top n #:left n …)         ; outer whitespace
(align  child 'left│'center│'right #:width n)
(width  child n)
(height child n #:valign 'top│'center│'bottom)
(fill   w h #:bg 'name-or-hex)
(pin    col row child)
(overlay base p1 p2 …)
(boxed  child #:border border-rounded #:fg 'name #:title "name")
(static child)                            ; cache rendered cmds keyed on rect
(on-click action child)
(on-hover child styler-proc)
(flex    child #:grow 1 #:shrink 0)
```

`pad` and `margin` are distinct: `pad` adds space *inside* a
boxed/styled region, `margin` adds space *outside*.

### Flex

`flex` tags an item inside a vbox or hbox as flexible. The box first
sums every item's intrinsic size along its major axis (height for
vbox, width for hbox). Any surplus is shared among flex items by
their `#:grow` shares; any deficit is shared by `#:shrink`. Items
without `flex` keep their intrinsic size; `flex` outside a vbox/hbox
is transparent.

```scheme
(vbox (txt "top bar")
      (flex middle)                       ; absorbs leftover height
      (txt "bottom bar"))

(hbox sidebar
      (flex canvas #:grow 1)
      (flex preview #:grow 2))            ; canvas 1/3, preview 2/3
```

Defaults: `#:grow 1 #:shrink 0` → "take any extra, don't shrink past
intrinsic". A bare `(flex x)` is the common case.

Don't subtract terminal dimensions to size items by hand
(`(width child (- cols 10))`). Wrap with `flex` and the box does the
math, even across resizes.

## Bundled components

Plain GOOPS classes in `canary/components/`:

- `<button>` — title + on-click
- `<panel>`  — title + border + footer + content, with hover affordance
- `<textinput>` — single-line input with cursor
- `<spinner>` — animated frames, installs its own ticker on `<init>`
- `<progress>` — bar with percentage
- `<paginator>` — page indicator with key bindings

Each exposes `make-X` as the constructor and a small set of accessors.
Embed an instance as a slot on your app class; the engine cascades
msgs into it automatically.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't** return new state from `update`. Mutate in place with the
  accessors, return `(values self cmd)`.
- **Don't** construct cmds as quoted lists: `'(set-title "x")` ✗,
  `(set-title "x")` ✓.
- **Don't** put style flags in a list: `#:attrs '(bold italic)` ✗,
  `#:bold #:italic` ✓.
- **Don't** poll for state changes. Every transition is a msg; every
  side-effect is a cmd.
- **Don't** issue `(alt-screen 'on)` / `(cursor 'hide)` / `(set-title
  …)` from your `<init>` update for the defaults. Pass them as kwargs
  to `run-app`.
- **Don't** side-effect inside `view`. The cascade walker calls it
  once to find children before render calls it again to produce
  cmds; any effect fires twice per msg.

## Module surface

```scheme
(use-modules (canary))
```

Re-exports the public surface — `view`, `update` generics,
layout primitives, theme/palette forms, keymap helpers, msg + cmd
constructors, `run-app`, `send`, `<key>` / `<mouse>` / `<tick>` etc.
See `canary.scm` for the full list.

Components are imported individually:
